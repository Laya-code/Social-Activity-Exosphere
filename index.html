    <h1>Exosphere</h1>
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The exosphere is the uppermost region of Earth's atmosphere as it gradually fades into the vacuum of space. ... The layer directly below the exosphere is the thermosphere; the boundary between the two is called the thermopause. The bottom of the exosphere is sometimes also referred to as the exobase.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="air">
        <h2>Air</h2>
        <p>The exosphere layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.</p>

        <h2>Know More</h2>

        <p>The exosphere begins at a distance of 311 to 621 miles from the earth's surface, and ends at approximately 6200 miles from the earth's surface.</p>
        <p>Although the exosphere is the most distance layer of earth's atmosphere it is the layer that is the planet's first line of defense against the sun's rays. It is also the first layer to come into contact and protect the earth from meteors, asteroids, and cosmic rays.</p>
        <p>The temperature in the exosphere varies greatly and can range from 0 to over 1700 degrees Celsius. It is colder at night and much hotter during the day.</p>
        <p>The air in the exosphere is very thin, and is made up mostly of helium, and hydrogen. Traces of other gases such as atomic oxygen and carbon dioxide can also be found.</p>
        <p>The upper level of the exosphere is the farthest point from earth that is still affected by earth's gravity. However this distance would be halfway to the moon, and is only considered to be true in a technical sense. Because of this the true boundary of the exosphere is debatable among scientists.</p>
        <p>If the boundary of the exosphere is considered to be where it is still affected by earth's gravity then the exosphere would be the largest part of earth's atmosphere. If the boundary of the exosphere is considered to be approximately 6200 miles from the earth's surface, as many believe, then the thermosphere is the largest portion of the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The geocorona is the name for the exosphere's part that is seen from earth.
        The exosphere is perfect for placing satellites as there is very little friction and they are able to orbit fairly easily without being disrupted.</p>
        <p>Most of the molecules that exist in the exosphere end up being pulled back into earth's lower atmospheric levels by gravity. Some do make it into outer space however because of the low level of gravity and pressure in the exosphere.</p>
